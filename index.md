## New Webpage, Same Ol' Me


Hello! My name is Michael Brown and this is my GitHub page..... *ta-daaaa!*
Let's be real... this is a bare-bones website to say the least. **But nevertheless!** This is only the beginning as I plan to post and update this page with more information about both myself and the projects I am working on. So for now, try and imagine some of the text below as *"place-holder"* until my next real-life patch rolls out.

```markdown
# Updates
- This markdown bubble will serve as my personal space to write any notes about my current endeavors and changes to the website.
- Current: Preparing external repository for future work at CodePath camp! Little to show for now; will update soon. https://github.com/mbrown-2/SimpleTodo
```
