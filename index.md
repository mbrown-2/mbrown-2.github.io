## New Webpage, Same Ol' Me

Hello! My name is Michael Brown and this is my GitHub page..... *ta-daaaa!*
Let's be real... this is a bare-bones website to say the least. **But nevertheless!** This is only the beginning as I plan to post and update this page with more information about both myself and the projects I am working on. So for now, try and imagine some of the text below as *"place-holder"* until my next real-life patch rolls out.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mbrown-2/mbrown-2.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
